Installation instructions
-------------------------

$ autoheader
$ autoconf
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
$ make
$ make install


Quickstart
----------

$ darkstat -i eth0


Slightly slower start
---------------------

$ man darkstat


Packaging
---------

The install target respects DESTDIR.  If you are packaging darkstat or
installing into a chroot, you can:

$ make install DESTDIR=/chroot/whatever


Portability
-----------

I, the darkstat maintainer, mostly develop darkstat on Debian GNU/Linux, but
mostly run darkstat on FreeBSD.

darkstat usually builds out-of-the-box on FreeBSD, although you should probably
install it from ports.

In the past, darkstat has also been reported to work on:

 - Solaris (with Sun C 5.8, and libpcap installed)
 - Fedora Core (with libpcap-devel installed)
 - OpenBSD
 - NetBSD
 - Mac OS X
 - AIX
 - Ubuntu (you need build-essential, zlib1g-dev, libpcap-dev)
 - Mandrake
 - OpenSUSE

Sadly, darkstat doesn't run on GNU/Hurd 0.3 because the BPF there doesn't
support non-blocking operation (FIONBIO).
